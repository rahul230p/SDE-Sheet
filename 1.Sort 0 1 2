Problem - Sort an array of 0 1 2 with sort() function

Approach -

1. Using sort -   TC- O(nlogn) SC-O(1)

2 . Counting sort - Linearly traverse the array and Count the no of 0 1 2s and print 0s first then 1s the 2s
   TC-  O(N)       +        O(N) 
          |                   |
         First loop to      Loop to print them  
         traverse
